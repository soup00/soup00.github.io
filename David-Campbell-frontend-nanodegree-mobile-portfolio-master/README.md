  1. No need to transform 200 pizzas, so get numbers of cols and rows to have the minimum visible requirement.
  2. Changed ```querySelectorAll``` with ```getElementsByClassName```
  3. Got size of array before loop
  4. Took ```phase``` out of the main loop
  5. Changes to the function ```changePizzaSizes(size)```
  6. Compressed the images
  7. Minified CSS
  8. Inlined the CSS to eliminate render-blocking
